This project uses C++ to quiz the user on the day of the week for any
random date between 1900 and 2100. The user is given the date (e.g. 4/1/2074)
and prompted to enter the day of the week as a number (sunday = 0, monday = 1, etc.).
The program uses the Doomsday algorithm made by John Conway to calculate the day,
and I use this same method to calculate it in my head when doing the quiz.
